## Discord bot for Wujek Place

Bot was made for the release of AJ1 Low x Travis Scott *Reverse Mocha*

### The bot has 2 features:
- using the following command `/modlitwa` will display a prayer to Travis;
- sending a message to a channel (`successChannelId`) of your choice will ping the sender in the main channel (`mainChannelId`) with a random nice message.

To configure channel IDs, simply head to [src/config.json](`./src/config.json`) and fill the values. To provide nice messages, edit [src/nice-messages.json](src/nice-messages.json) and put the messages there.
